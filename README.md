# Key-factor-in-satisfaction-survey-using-Supervised-Learning-Classification-Model
Identify the key factor in passangers satisfaction survey for an airline.

Solution Scope

This solution uses an airline's corporate Passenger Satisfaction Survey to be processed by a machine learning model and show which aspect, if it could be improved, would achieve a higher level of passenger satisfaction if the appropriate improvement measures are taken in that aspect.

The model and its hyperparameters illustrated here have been selected after an evaluation of the data as well as multiple classification models performance.

The F1-Score has been chosen as the selection criterion for key survey factor due to its rigor as a harmonic mean of precision and recall, since a low value in precision or recall will significantly reduce the F1-Score and since it is desired to obtain an evaluation of values in a range of 0.8 to 1.0 (Strong).
